<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Interaction SDK Experimental is a library of modular, composable components that allows developers to implement a range of robust, standardized interactions (including grab, poke, raycast and more) for controllers and hands. Interaction SDK also includes tooling to help developers build their own hand poses.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The main idea of this repo, is that you can test the new Interaction SDK in the quickest way possible, so let's get to the point!
### Prerequisites

1. An Oculus device.
2. A windows or mac computer.
### Installation

1. Download the latest version of Unity 2020.3LTS (2020.3.27f1 at this time). <a href="https://unity3d.com/es/get-unity/download"><strong>Unity download! »</strong></a>

2. Clone the repository, or just download it as a zip file. If you want to clone and start learning about source control tools, we recommend starting out with Github Desktop, which also has direct integration with Github.com. <a href="https://desktop.github.com/"><strong>Github Desktop download. »</strong></a>
3. Open your downloaded/cloned Unity project using Unity Hub.

## Usage

With this project, you can both test in the editor using an Oculus Link cable together with your Oculus Quest/Rift, or you can build an apk to install in your Quest device.

If you want to build an APK, make sure you switch Unity's build settings to Android going to File > Build Settings.
IF you want to use Link Cable, you can just plug your device, enable Link cable from within the Oculus Quest, and then press "Play" in the Unity Editor.
